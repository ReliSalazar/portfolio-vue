            About three years ago, when I saw object-oriented programming for
            the first time, I realized a curious thing, and it is that it has a
            great resemblance to Plato's Theory of Ideas, at the time Imade a
            couple of jokes with that and in part, it helped me understand the
            concept better, but a few days ago I revisited this idea and began
            to reflect on the subject, so I write this post so that those
            reflections do not remain only in my head.
            <br />
            But first I would like to give an explanation about what exactly
            Plato's Theory of Ideas was. Broadly speaking, we could explain it
            as a series of three dualisms to explain reality.

            This is an old post from a blog I used to have called Lambda Lain,
            now, I understand a lot better things related this, but I'm going to
            keep the blog as it was.

          <h3 class="subtitle underline-purple">Ontological dualism</h3>
        </paragraph>

        <paragraph>
          <p>
            The first dualism is the
            <strong>ontological</strong>
            one, that is, of reality; which consists of dividing reality into
            two worlds, on one hand the sensible world and on the other one the
            intelligible world.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the <strong>sensible world,</strong> there are sensible things,
            that is, all those that are subject to change, while in the
            <strong>intelligible wolrd,</strong> it is where the ideas or forms
            or subsisting essences of things exists.
          </p>
        </paragraph>

        <paragraph>
          <p>
            A couple of examples would be that in the sensible world horses run,
            while in the intelligible world there is the idea of a horse. In the
            sensible world there are humans, while in the intelligible world
            there is the idea of being human. Although Plato's favorite examples
            always refer to <strong>values:</strong> justice itself, beauty
            itself, courage itself, etc.
          </p>
        </paragraph>

        <paragraph>
          <p>
            An important thing to keep in mind is that Plato's ideas are not the
            same as what we commonly understand as "idea", it doesn't refer to
            the moment when something occurs to you. Plato's ideas
            <strong>doesn't</strong>
            need us to think of them to exist.
          </p>
        </paragraph>

        <paragraph>
          <p>
            Plato's referred to this concept as eidos, which translates more or
            less as "idea" and comes from the Greek verb éido which means "to
            see", that is, the eidos, the idea is something that you can see,
            with the intellect and is outside of us. Plato's idea is not a
            mental notion.
          </p>
        </paragraph>

        <paragraph>
          <p>
            Plato was highly influenced by Socrates when thinking about this
            idea, as you surely know, Socrates was a man who went around asking
            people the definition of things, what is love? what is justice?
          </p>
          <p>
            Socrates' activity then consists in asking about the essence, the
            <strong>"what"</strong> of something. Being the essence what remains
            below the changes or the possible multiplicity.
          </p>
        </paragraph>

        <paragraph>
          <p>
            An example of change is yourself: you were conceived, you were born,
            you grew up and at some point you are going to die, but in all these
            changes you have remained as a human being.
          </p>
        </paragraph>

        <paragraph>
          <p>
            An example of multiplicity is that there are millions of human
            beings, they are all very different, but there is something that
            makes us say that they all have something in common and that is that
            they are all human beings. This is what we speak of when we refer to
            the <strong>essence.</strong>
          </p>
        </paragraph>

        <paragraph>
          <p>
            The process of construction of the theory of ideas begins when Plato
            begins to ask himself: What is the ontological status of essence?
            i.e. this essence that is the answer to the Socratic question, where
            is it? how is it? what is it? what type of reality or entity does it
            have?
          </p>
        </paragraph>

        <paragraph>
          <p>
            the reasoning is more or less the following: there are just acts and
            unjust acts, that is something we see every day, but there could not
            be just and unjust acts if justice did not exist in some way. or,
            there are beautiful things, but beautiful things could not exist, if
            somehow beauty didn't exists. terefore, this essence of things,
            justice and beauty, have to exist. if they didn't exist, i could not
            find these characteristics in things. it would not make sence to
            say: "this flower seems beautiful to me" if beauty itself doesn't
            exist.
          </p>
        </paragraph>

        <paragraph>
          <p>
            Now, I don't meet beauty on the street, I meet things that
            <strong>are beautiful,</strong>
            in the same way I don't meet justice on the street, I meet acts that
            are fair or unfair, I can even do them, but I don't create justice,
            rather, I can do acts that <strong>are fair.</strong>
          </p>
        </paragraph>

        <paragraph>
          <p>
            Therefore, if justice and beautiful exist, and they have to exist
            because if not, I cannot explain the phenomena that I find myself in
            the sensible world, they have to exist, in another place, and also
            be of a non-sensitive nature, because I have never seen or touched
            them.
          </p>
        </paragraph>

        <paragraph>
          <p>
            But, even though I have never seen or touched ideas, I know them, I
            recognize them, because I recognize them in things. How is this
            recognition possible? Well, not with the senses, but with reason.
            This is where the following dualism comes in: the
            <strong>epistemological</strong> one that means
            <strong>knowledge.</strong>
          </p>
        </paragraph>

        <paragraph>
          <h3>Epistemological dualism</h3>
        </paragraph>

        <paragraph>
          <p>
            In knowledge, on one hand we have the senses and on the other hand
            we have the reason. The reason is who knows or recognizes the ideas,
            essences or forms from the data that the senses give us. So far, we
            have two worlds, one in which sensible things exist and another
            where intelligible things, ideas or forms exist. Futhermore, we have
            two modes of knowledge, one for each world: the
            <strong>senses and reason.</strong>
          </p>
        </paragraph>

        <paragraph>
          <p>
            These two dualisms correspond in turn to a third,
            <strong>anthropological dualism,</strong> which divides the human
            being into two realities, <strong>body and soul.</strong>
          </p>
        </paragraph>

        <paragraph>
          <h3>Anthropological dualism</h3>
        </paragraph>

        <paragraph>
          <p>
            The body corresponds to the sensible world and the senses, while the
            soul corresponds to the world of ideas and reason. But in this
            dualism, the relationship between the two extremes is more
            conflictive. The body is here, in Plato's words, the prison of the
            soul <strong>[Phaedo, 82e].</strong> And the soul yearns above all
            to free itself from the body and return to the world of ideas to
            directly contemplate the object of its desire.
          </p>
        </paragraph>

        <paragraph>
          <p>
            Returning to ontological dualism, here each of the two worlds
            corresponds to a series of characteristics that can then be
            transferred to each of its correlates, to the senses and the body,
            and to reason and the soul. These characteristics will be in
            opposition all the time, for example, if the sensible world is
            visible, the intelligible world is invisible, if the sensible world
            is mutable, the seat of change, then the intelligible world is
            immutable, the seat of what doesn't change, of what remains.
          </p>
        </paragraph>

        <paragraph>
          <p>
            if sensible things are temporary, intelligible things are eternal
            and unchanging. If sensible things are bodily, ideas are
            disembodied, inexistent and don't take up space. If the sensible is
            mortal the ideastic, the ideas are inmortal. If sensible things are
            imperfect, the ideas are perfect.
          </p>
        </paragraph>

        <paragraph>
          <p>
            This is transferred above all to the position between body and soul,
            in fact many Christian philosophers take up this idea to talk about
            the relationship between God and humans, in addition to their idea
            of the soul.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ideas are so much more real than things, that if there were no
            ideas, there would be no things as we know and understand them.
            Ideas are the foundation, the base, the condition of possibillity of
            things, that things are what they are and that we can know them,
            because if there were nothing stable or permanent in change, we
            couldn't know.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ideas are the <strong>true reality,</strong>
            everything that is real in things, they owe to ideas.
          </p>
        </paragraph>

        <note>
          <p>
            Given all this information, I think it is easy to deduce that for
            Plato, the world of ideas was more real than the sensible world,
            since things are mere copies of ideas.
          </p>
        </note>

        <paragraph>
          <h3>How are things and ideas related?</h3>
        </paragraph>

        <paragraph>
          <p>Plato explains the relationship with three metaphors:</p>
        </paragraph>

        <paragraph>
          <h4>The Participation (méthexis)</h4>
          <p>
            From bottom to top, from the thing to the idea: The thing
            participates in the idea, the thing aspires to the idea, tries to
            resemble or exemplify it, as if it were oriented to the idea and
            wanted to achieve its perfection, the idea is its model and the
            thing tries to imitate it.
          </p>
        </paragraph>

        <paragraph>
          <h4>The Presence (parousía)</h4>
          <p>
            from top to bottom, from the idea to the thing: the idea becomes
            present in the thing, the idea manifests itself in the sensible
            world through the thing.
          </p>
        </paragraph>

        <paragraph>
          <h4>The Community (koinonía)</h4>
          <p>
            Double direction: There is a certain communion or community between
            the thing and the idea, this is explained by the double relationship
            seen before.
          </p>
        </paragraph>

        <paragraph>
          <p>
            This is a small sketch of Plato's perceptions, he throughout his
            life revisits, changes and reflects on his thoughts, for example: At
            first he thought that there were ideas of both positive and negative
            reality, that is, like, as there is justice, the is injustice, but
            it ends up rejecting this, leaving only the ideas of positive
            reality, the negative ones being the absence of the positive ones.
          </p>
        </paragraph>

        <paragraph>
          <p>
            Later he incorporates mathematical principles as ideas and in
            another dialogue he introduces the figure of the Demiurge who is a
            kind of God or Demigod who, like a kind of sculptor, sculpts or
            models material reality taking ideas as a model.
          </p>
        </paragraph>

        <paragraph>
          <p>
            Another interesting change is the hierarchy of ideas. There must be
            a upreme idea, but in the banquet dialogue, the supreme idea is
            <strong>beauty</strong>, and in the dialogue the republic the
            supreme idea has changed and is <strong>good.</strong>
          </p>
        </paragraph>

        <paragraph>
          <p>
            Recapitulating, Plato's philosophy can be broadly structured into
            three correlated dualisms, these being:
            <strong>ontological, epistemological and anthropological</strong>
          </p>
        </paragraph>

        <paragraph>
          <p>
            <strong>Ontological</strong> divides reality into two worlds, the
            sensible and the intelligible. <strong>Epistemological</strong>
            divides knowledge between the senses and reason.
            <strong>Anthropological</strong> divides the human being into body
            and soul.
          </p>
        </paragraph>

        <paragraph>
          <p>
            In these dualisms the primacy always corresponds to the non-material
            and non-sensible extreme, that is: To ideas about things, to reason
            respect to the senses and the soul respect to the body. Finally we
            have seen that there is a certain community between sensible things
            and their ideas that explains their relationship, things participate
            in the idea and the idea is present or manifested in things.
          </p>
        </paragraph>

        <paragraph>
          <p>
            The key to all this is to realize that Plato defends that without
            ideas, without essences or forms as separate subsisting realities,
            the sensible world cannot be explained, the world of phenomena as we
            know it, ideas are the model of things and things are a mere copy,
            whitout the model, the copy couldn't be explained.
          </p>
        </paragraph>

        <paragraph>

            But at the end of the day, what does all this have to do with
            Christmas?
          </h3>
        </paragraph>

        <paragraph>
          <p>
            Well, object-oriented programming starts from a similar idea,
            broadly speaking, it consists of abstracting objects from real life
            to code, through their properties and methods, the things that make
            it what it is and how it interacts with its enviroment. That is,
            instead of having a variable called temperature, we have an object
            called thermometer, which has a numerical property that reflects the
            current temperature, data that it gives us through a method, and
            through another method it's constantly changing. It is, indeed the
            idea of a thermometer represented through the code.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            When we write software and we extract all procedural thinking from
            our code and focus solely on using objects, the object becomes a
            software abstracton of reality.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            When you write software, you are translating your ideas, your
            concepts, into code. Ideas that live in the machine that executes
            it, through its behaviors and interactions with other objects, all
            defined by you. Each programmer is the Demiurge who takes ideas and
            molds them to form sensible things, projects his mind on the
            software.
          </p>
        </paragraph>

        <note>
          <p>
            Actually there is something called Object-Oriented Otnology, that is
            a philosophical position that objects exist independently of human
            perceptiond and questions the central role of human perspective
            within traditional philosophy.
          </p>
        </note>

        <paragraph>
          <p>
            But, for what purpose? Transfer those ideas to others, of course. It
            is to visit that inhospitable territory, that region from which
            everything emanates, the world of ideas, with the aim of bringing
            the touch of the abstract, an extract of the perfect and capturing
            that glance in a sensitive but intangible thing on silicon. Very
            similar to how the artist does.

          <p>
            We could even extrapolate it to the level of language, because in
            the end, a programming language is not very different from a
            language like the one you speak and the one I speak, it is a
            language to communicate with machines, exactly like Spanish and
            English helps us communicate with other people. Words are a mutual
            agreement, it's to give meaning to a series of sounds and symbols to
            represent ideas, and that, put together, represent more complex
            ideas and transmit them to others. This forms a direct
            correspondence between
            <strong>word, idea and software.</strong>
          </p>
        </paragraph>

        <paragraph>
          <p>
            Is language a representation of the world of ideas? Or, are
            languages really that world of ideas? What is the role of software
            in all this? To what extent are we creating a new sensible but
            intangible layer?
          </p>
        </paragraph>

        <paragraph>
          <p>
            Because, we are creating sensible, but intangible things, nothing
            more than through the contact that we can have with ideas through
            reason, they are things that manifest in the sensible world, because
            we can see them, we can interact with them through of our
