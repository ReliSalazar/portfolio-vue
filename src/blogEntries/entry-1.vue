            Hello, my real name is Kevin Enrique Loera Salazar, I am currently

            Since I can remember, I have always had a great afinity for
            computers, even my mother often tells me that I wanted to create
            robots and she talked about it all the time.

            My first contact with software development was more or less in 2014,
            I tried to do a video game programming course with Unity using
            monodevelop and C#, but honestly it was too difficult, today I know
            that it is one of the most complex areas in the software
            development, but the good side is that the experience only gave me
            determination to start something simpler.

            shortly after I started learning C++ with the book

            What I like most about software development is the feeling of
            creating things from nothing, it is almost magical, you write a
            spell and something appears that a few hours ago did not exist and
            with which you can interact, and above all, it solves a problem.

        <note>
          <p>
            This isn't actually the first book I read about programming, but
            it's the most important for me.

            Over time I also learned other technologies such as Python, GoLang,
            C#, HTML, JS, React, Vue, TypeScript, PHP and Laravel. Although I
            have also tried other things such as video game development with the
            GML or Python using Godot, or development for Arduino with C.

            I also plan not only to finish the Python course that I currently
            have on

            but to do more courses, as well as a podcast on different topics.
